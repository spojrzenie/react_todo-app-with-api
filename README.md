![GitHub Logo](/todoapp.png)

## Demo

You can see the live demo of the application [here](https://spojrzenie.github.io/react_todo-app-with-api/).

## Project Description

The ToDo application is a simple task management tool built using React. It utilizes an API for data storage and manipulation. This project was created for the purpose of learning and practicing JavaScript programming, working with the React library, and communicating with a server through an API.

## Features

### Adding Tasks

- You can add a new task by entering its content in the text input field and pressing Enter. If the field is empty, an error message will be displayed.
- The task is then added to the task list.

### Editing Tasks

- You can edit an existing task by double-clicking on its content. After making changes, press Enter or click outside the text field to save the edits.

### Removing Tasks

- Each task can be removed by clicking the "Ã—" button next to it.

### Marking Tasks as Completed/Uncompleted

- You can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to a task. Unchecking it marks the task as uncompleted.

### Task Filtering

- You can filter tasks by status: all, active, or completed.
- Click the corresponding tab on the top bar to display tasks matching the selected status.

### Removing Completed Tasks

- You can remove all completed tasks using the "Clear completed" button at the bottom of the page.

### Task Counter

- The bottom of the page displays a counter of remaining tasks to be completed.

### Error Messages

- In case of API issues or task operations, error messages are displayed at the top of the page and disappear after a few seconds.
